					<h3 id="about-distraction">Distraction magazine is a sophisticated, high-gloss magazine that is committed to defining the culture of University of Miami’s student body. This publication serves as an entertaining and insightful “Distraction” to the daily stress of college life and features new trends in music, fashion, art, entertainment and student interests. As editor-in- chief this past year, I am responsible for managing a staff of over 50 people, as well as seeing that every story, headline, design, photo and caption is conceptualized, executed and sent to print without a blemish. As editor, I create the budget for every issue and make sure that every photo, design and story is picked. I’m responsible for brainstorming photo and design concepts with our core team to establish the direction we want to take every page of the magazine, and then organizing and attending studio days and shoots for us to bring our ideas to life. From wasabi typography to campfires to custom condoms, my staff has been working on redefining what goes inside a college magazine and how we can go about creating that.
