					<h3 id="description1">Video packages are something I’ve always wanted to create, especially those that tell the type of story that no else one is really telling. For my “Inside Islam” piece, I wanted to juxtapose the current mainstream media’s portrayal of this religion with the stories of local Miami students, families and religious officials who live their lives with the complete opposite value.</h3>
					<h3 id="description2">“Egypt: Post Revolution” is a package I made as a sophomore in high school, a few months after former President Hosni Muburak was ousted after the 2011 Egyptian revolution. While the revolution stole most headlines, the aftermath was rarely talked about. I wanted to go to the streets where change happened and talk to the people who lived through it and were dealing with its effects.</h3>
