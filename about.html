          <h3 id="about-me">Hello there! My name is Asmae Fahmy and I am a soon-to- be graduate of the University of

Miami with a Bachelor of Science in journalism and psychology. College has allowed me to

dabble in a little bit of everything, from photography to design to pulling multiple all-nighters

and somehow maintaining my sanity. When I think of my comfort zone, I don’t think of a

distinct place. Instead, I think of words. Words in magazines. Words in books. Words in

newspapers. Words shuffled into a radio segment or bleeding onto a letter. Nothing brings me

more joy than a perfectly crafted sentence that bridges that elusive space between reader and

writer. I like words that aren’t pinned down to the rough edges of paper. Words that move

beyond ink and carry the power to change things – moods, decisions, ideas, people. Those are

the kinds of words I live for. Those are the kinds of words I aim to create.
